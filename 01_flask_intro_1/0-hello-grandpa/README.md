Hello Grandpa
=============

This exercise is just to start your fingers off writing some Flask.

Build a web app which listens to three routes:
* `/hello-grandpa`
* `/goodbye-grandpa`
* `/i-love-you-grandpa`

Visit these routes at `http://localhost:5000`.

For each route, your app should return an appropriate response from
grandpa.
