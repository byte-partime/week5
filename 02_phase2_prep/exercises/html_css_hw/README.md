# Your Portfolio Using HTML and CSS

### This is something we will be using throughout the next month so be prepared to refactor this over and over again as we learn more about HTML / CSS / and JS

---

##### BEFORE YOU START BUILDING YOUR PORTFOLIO!!!!!!

* After you have finished reading the lesson plans and practicing the examples check out [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/)
* This is a great interactive tool that forces you to target the proper elements

##### Objectives

* You will start to build your own portfolio
* Take some time to look online for ideas and think about what you want to build
* Similar to Pseudo Coding, you should be wireframing your site. That is drawing out the layout of your website. 
* Some things you might consider:
	* Is there a nav bar?
	* Where will it be located?
	* Is there a drop down menu?
	* Is there a back to top button?
	* Where will there be image?
	* How many paragraphs will you have?
* If you need some placeholder text to fill your paragraphs with random content check out Lorem Ipsum.
	* Lorem Ipsums are random content generators
	* There are all kinds of different ones. Check out the two below:
		* [Beer Ipsum](http://random-ize.com/lorem-ipsum-generators/beer/)
		* [Arnold Schwarzenegger Ipsum](http://ipsum-generators.com/view/?id=4)
