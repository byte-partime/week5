# Your Image Gallery

### Requirements

* You have been provided with an image folder with 20+ images
* Using what you have learned build an image gallery where a user can scroll back and forth between images. 

### Approach

* Make the following three files.
	* index.html
	* style.css
	* main.js
* Hook up all three files properly. You can test them to see if they work.
	* `make a console log`
	* `change the background color`
* Everything hooked up? Great.
* `DO NOT BEGIN CODING!!! WIREFRAME YOUR SITE FIRST!!!`
* Before doing any coding draw out your website. Feel free to google other image galleries or image sliders to grab ideas. 
* Keep things as basic as possible. As your skills improve you can refactor this assignment and all your other assignments. 
* Make sure when planning you understand the relationships of parent elements and nested child elements. 
	* Example: Maybe the best way to size an image is to put the img tag to 100% and just wrap it in a div that you can control. This might be handy since all images are different sizes.
